MPP
A web application I made over the 2nd semester of the 2nd year at UBB.
This was also my first experience with React, Express-js and application deployment. During the making of this project, I got the full stack developer experience. 
used MaterialUI for some frontend elements (tables, buttons, charts)
at first, the database used to be stored in a json file, later I moved the data into a mysql database and in the end i migrated the database to an aws database.
for the deployment i used a free online service called render which simply allowed me to upload my backend through github.

i tested the frontend using playwright (tests are still available in the frontend files)
tested the backend with postman (made sure the api calls return the right status)

used faker-js at some point to generate random entities for my database

the frontend of the app can be found in the mpp-project directory
